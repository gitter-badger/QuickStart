QuickStart is my current build system for Node. It is my template engine for creating websites using JS, SASS, PUG

## Install Packages

After cloning the project to your computer run the following command in your terminal to install all required node packages.

    sudo npm install

## Features

- Uglify: minification.
- BrowserSync.
- Sass
- Pug

## How to use

Precompiled JS, SCSS and PUG files are in the src folder and compile to public.  All other files including HTML, image etc. are in public.  BrowserSync runs from public and serves as the "Dist" folder for client-side apps.

## Creadit

Give creadit where creadit is due.
Quickstart is my build system that is based upon <a href="https://github.com/joellongie/superCell">SuperCell</a> from author joellongie
